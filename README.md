## Overview
This week, we will be introducing web scraping. In this unit, you will first learn the basic setup of webpages with HTML and CSS. You will then learn how to use Beautiful Soup to navigate the HTML in order to scrape out the contents that they want. Then, you will expand on this skill by using the Splinter library to automate the process and store your results in a Mongo database.

You will need to make sure that the web-driver manager is installed into your virtual environments. You can do so by running pip install webdriver_manager in your environment.

Other tools:
* BeautifulSoup
* Splinter
* MongoDB
* Flask-PyMongo
* html5lib and lxml
